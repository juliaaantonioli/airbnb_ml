Introducing Airbnb Pricing Inc.'s mission to provide precise pricing recommendations for Airbnb hosts in New York City. I analyzed a dataset of 102,599 unique Airbnb listings, uncovering key factors influencing pricing and patterns essential for crafting effective price-prediction models. Through extensive data preparation, exploratory analysis, and advanced regression techniques, I offer actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing Airbnb listing prices.

Highlights of my study include:

- Extensive data preprocessing to ensure accuracy and relevance for machine learning applications.
- Exploration of the dynamic pricing landscape, revealing significant variations across neighborhoods, room types, and operational strategies.
- Identification of potential for price optimization in districts like Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island, along with pivotal factors such as listing availability, minimum nights, and room type.

My methodology combines linear and tree-based regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to accurately forecast optimal pricing strategies. I utilized model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2), with computational efficiency in mind.

The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most effective model, striking a balance between accuracy and generalizability, resulting in robust pricing recommendations for Airbnb hosts in New York City.
